The Cloudify-6G project aims to advance the integration of cloud technology with mobile networks as the industry transitions from 5G to 6G. 
It seeks to create flexible and efficient connectivity solutions by focusing on developing next-generation radio access networks that leverage a common AI/ML platform for implementing algorithms. 
The project intends to achieve this by sharing of state information between radio network functions and cloud applications.
With support from mobile operators and software companies, the project will create a prototype platform to validate its concepts and demonstrate its potential for various industry applications

The [project team](/team/) consists of researchers from the University of Helsinki, Aalto University, and VTT. 

The steering group of this project includes DNA, Elisa, Telia, Konecranes, ABB, Cumucore, and Nokia.
