The University of Helsinki, Aalto University, and VTT organized a workshop at Thinkcorner on June 16th to discuss the future landscape of telecom and computing in the post LLM era


The workshop consisted of three keynote talks and one panel discussions spread across the following two session. 

### Session 1

1. **Let's not do that again - lessons from 5G for future networks**  
Prof. Henning Schulzrinne, Columbia University.  
_Abstract_:  
The 5G evolution, economics, and use cases can teach us valuable lessons as we explore future networks.
Next-generation networks should aim for simplicity, take into account the skill sets of the IT workforce, and focus on economic key performance indicators. 
The increased availability of fiber to the home and satellite networks allows future cellular networks to focus on their key ecological niche rather than trying to be the universal network.​

2. **Panel on AI in Mobile Networks for Verticals**  
_Moderator_
: Tao Chen  
_Panelists_
: Henning Schulzrinne, Columbia University​  
: Henri Kivioja, Rain.global​  
: Joel Reijonen, Ericsson​

### Session 2

1. **Recycled mobile phones as a computer vision-based edge computing solution with complete privacy**  
Kimmo Pentikäinen​, Supersight Ltd.  
_Abstract_:  
Computer vision technology has been expensive, inaccurate and uncertain.
However, computer vision technology has huge potential to solve many of the challenges facing society, such as climate change. 
In our research and product development, we propose to use standard hardware, mobile phones, as a solution for computer vision edge computing. 
In addition, there are significant cost benefits from the use of second-hand phones and the possibility to recycle obsolete devices into smart sensors.​

2. **Quality of data and information: the key to future​**  
Kimmo Hätönen​, Nokia Bell Labs​.  
_Abstract_:  
6G technology will bring AI/ML into the heart of telecommunication networks.
When moving from 5G to 6G technologies, one of the biggest architectural change, will be the way how data needs to be treated and shared among semiautonomous agents adjusting the network on fly.
In my presentation, I will discuss about the requirements and challenges that new data architecture and technologies will face.​
